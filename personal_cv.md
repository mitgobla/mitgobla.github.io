## Professional Profile

I am a dedicated and passionate Computer Science graduate with a First Class Honours from Swansea University. I have proven experience in various programming languages including Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, Kotlin, and SQL. Skilled in using Rasberry Pi and LEGO Mindstorm hardware for innovative projects. Furthermore I am proficient in using Git, Github, Notion, and Jira for project management and version control.

My previous experience as a Marketplace Coordinator at Ziax and CubeCraft Games has allowed me to demonstrate my ability to work in a team and mentor new members.

The projects I have worked on show that I am committed to continous learning and problem solving where I can learn new skills and technologies to further my career.

Outside of programming I enjoy playing video games, building computers, and gardening. I have a hobby for mixology and creating cocktail recipes.
