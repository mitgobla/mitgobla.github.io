## Overview

GroupQuiz is a website designed to host activities such as quizzes and voting events. It was initially created as a side project for our school's annual Charities Day, with the aim of engaging more people in activities that incorporate their mobile phones.

## Key Features

- **Simple Design**: The website uses Bootstrap 4 for a responsive design and Jinja2 to automatically populate pages with necessary information.
- **Unique Usernames**: On first visit, users are assigned a random fun username and grouped by their year.
- **Currency System**: Activities can cost credits or be free to enter. Users purchase a unique code that provides 10 credits for use on the website.
- **Easy Setup**: Quizzes and events are stored in JSON for easy addition, removal, or editing. Customizable question timings are also available.
- **Quick Control**: An admin panel provides statistics on user numbers and event entries.

## Backstory

The project was a successful endeavor to increase engagement during our school's Charities Day. It served as a learning experience, enhancing our understanding of Flask, MySQL, CSS, Javascript, and Jinja2. The server was run on one of our computers, allowing people to connect to a specific point to visit the GroupQuiz website.
