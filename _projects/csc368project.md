## Overview

As part of my Embedded System Design course, I was tasked with completing various tasks using EV3 robots and Python in a group of 3 people. The tasks were as follows:

1. Analysing the robot's sensors and recording the data.
2. Testing the motors to determine rotation speed and accuracy.
3. Developing a spot finding robot and testing it.
4. Developing a line (with gaps) following robot and testing it.
5. Developing a line (without gaps) following robot and testing it.
6. Devloping a maze solving robot and testing it.
