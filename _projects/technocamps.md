I discovered my interest in Computer Science through a Robotics Club called Team Lightning in secondary school. This led me to participate in the First Lego League, representing my school in national and international competitions. During this time I participated in many Technocamps robotics competitions. My enthusiasm for programming and robotics grew, leading me to mentor younger pupils in these areas.

During my university degree I continued to work with the Technocamps team as a Senior Ambassador. I am keen on inspiring others like myself who have little understanding of how to turn an interest in computers and robotics into a career. I believe that programming and robotics, which were daunting to me at first, can be made accessible to everyone, and I am committed to making that happen.
