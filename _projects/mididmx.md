## Overview

During our school charity day we experimented with creating software to control the lighting desk using MIDI, since it has a MIDI input. At the time we couldn't find any software that could do this, so we decided to create our own. We used the Python library `mido` to handle the MIDI output. We also used the `PyQT5` library to create a GUI for the software.
